## Operating interface for large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks

This project is a proof of concept, for showing that it is possible to create a Graphical User Interface for a Wireless Sensor Networks. The GUI provides an easy drag-and-drop interface for creating a WSN and then exporting it as a Bigraph algebraic expression or a BIG file.  

The program is available in the BigraphUI.jar file.

## Program structure

The program consists of a controller package that handles the relationship between each node, area, and application. As well as exports the WSN to a Bigraph expression and BIG file.  

The application package contains the structure for the graphical elements of the application.
